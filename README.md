# emotion_recognition_reports

These are two reports that I have written on non-verbal emotion recognition technologies (which strongly relates to the topic of my upcoming dissertation).

- [Report 1](https://github.com/jacobghdean/emotion_recognition_reports/blob/main/Report%201%20Non-Verbal%20Affective%20Computing.pdf) looks at the cutting edge of non-verbal emotion recognition
- [Report 2](https://github.com/jacobghdean/emotion_recognition_reports/blob/main/Report%202%20Non-Verbal%20Affective%20Computing.pdf) assesses and compares the research methods used in academic papers on non-verbal emotion recognition
